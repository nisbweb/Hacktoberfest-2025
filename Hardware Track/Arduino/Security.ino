// Design a password-protected system using Arduino.

// The system should use a 4x4 keypad to enter a 4-digit password.

// The user should be given a maximum of 3 attempts to enter the correct password.

// If the correct password is entered, a green LED should turn ON to indicate access granted.

// If all 3 attempts fail, a buzzer should sound continuously and a red LED should blink,

// indicating access denied.
