# 🧰 Community Skill Barter Platform

A platform where users can offer a skill (e.g., “teach guitar”) and request another (e.g., “learn Spanish”). Users can browse available skills and match with others to “barter” skills. Think of it as a community skill exchange system — simple to start, but with room for advanced features.
